 logical operators : is used to combine multiple  conditions .they only work with boolean values . (true,false) values

 1) !   -----> means NOt
 2) || ------> means Or
 3) && ------> means And

 why we use them?

 1) they can greatly simplify the logic
 2) it helps us reduce the lines of code that we have to wright.

 ! (Not) :  this operator is used to change the value if true i t changes it to false or if the value is false it changes it to true
  ex system.out.println(!true) result is = false


  2) Logical operator (||): Or

  it combines two or more conditions and returns true as long as there is one true condition, if all the conditions are falls
  it will return false

  3 logical And &&: it also combine tow or more conditions it only returns true if all the conditions are true.
