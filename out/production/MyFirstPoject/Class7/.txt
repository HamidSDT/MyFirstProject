while loop:
they help us repeat code .

why should we use while loops :
because manually copy and pasting is very bad, and it is not scalable .
also reducing the number of codes that need to be written .

Syntax while loop:

while(condition ){
code that we want to repeat
increment/decrement. ++ or --
}
